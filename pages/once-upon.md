## Preface: Transparency

This page is a work in progress. It is a living document that will be updated as we learn more about the Once Upon program and its impact on people's lives. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [hello@onefact.org](mailto:hello@onefact.org). If you don't want to read this page, that's totally cool ðŸ˜Š as we're not here to convince you of anything. We're here to share what we've learned and help you make your own decisions.
